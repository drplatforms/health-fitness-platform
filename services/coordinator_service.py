        Use available profile context directly when helpful.
        Example wording:
        "At roughly 190 lb with a strength/recomposition goal..."
        Do not use profile context to invent hard calorie or macro prescriptions.

        Critical final report guardrails:
        - Missing nutrition fields are unknown, not zero intake.
        - Do not say 0 kcal, 0 g protein, 0 g carbs, or 0 g fat unless those values were explicitly logged as 0.
        - If nutrition data is incomplete, describe it as incomplete rather than as severe restriction.
        - Average sleep is measured in hours/night, not on a 10-point scale.
        - If average sleep is 5.3, say approximately 5.3 hours/night. Do not say 5.3/10.
        - RIR means reps in reserve.
        - RIR 0-1 means low RIR / high effort / close to failure.
        - RIR 2-3 means more reps left in reserve than RIR 0-1.
        - Moving from RIR 0-1 to RIR 2-3 means raising RIR, reducing effort, and leaving more reps in reserve.
        - Never describe RIR 0-1 as high RIR.
        - Never say "lower RIR to 2-3" when current RIR is 0-1.
        - Treat suspicious micronutrient values cautiously.
        - Do not assume supplementation, over-supplementation, or true intake without confirmation.
        - Do not recommend reducing supplements or fortified foods unless supplementation or fortified-food intake is confirmed.
        - Avoid fixed carbohydrate targets such as 20-40g or 40-60g unless supported by body weight, training volume, and user goal context.
        - For carbohydrate guidance, use contextual wording based on training load, recovery status, body weight, and goals.
        - Avoid absolute protein targets unless current body weight is available.

        Forbidden final report wording:
        - Any phrase that combines "high RIR" or "high-RIR" with "0", "1", or "0-1"
        - "high-RIR lifts (0-1)"
        - "high-RIR session" when referring to RIR 0-1
        - "high RIR (near-failure efforts)"
        - "high RIR risks overtraining"
        - "Replace high-RIR (0-1)"
        - "sleep deprivation (5.3/10)"
        - "likely from supplements"
        - "reduce supplements" unless supplement use is confirmed
        - "20-40g carbs" or "40-60g carbs" as a fixed recommendation without context

        RIR wording requirements:
        - For RIR 0-1, the ONLY acceptable labels are:
          "low RIR", "high effort", "near failure", "close to failure", or "low-RIR/high-effort work".
        - Never pair the phrase "high RIR" with values 0, 1, or 0-1.
        - The phrase "high RIR" may only be used for RIR 4+.
        - If discussing RIR 0-1, always say "low RIR" instead of "high RIR".
        - If recommending RIR 2-3 from current RIR 0-1, say "raise RIR to 2-3" or "move toward RIR 2-3", never "lower RIR."

        Micronutrient wording requirements:
        - Do not use "likely" when explaining suspicious micronutrient values.
        - Use "may reflect" instead.
        - Do not recommend reducing supplements, fortified foods, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, or zinc unless the source is confirmed.
        - Recommend verification first.

        Macro recommendation requirements:
        - Do not give fixed calorie, protein, carbohydrate, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, or zinc targets unless required context is available.
        - Prefer qualitative guidance: "evaluate relative to body weight, training load, recovery status, goals, and logged intake completeness."

        Required replacement language:
        - Say "low-RIR/high-effort work at RIR 0-1."
        - Say "for 1-2 weeks, keep most working sets around RIR 2-3 instead of RIR 0-1."
        - Say "approximately 5.3 hours/night," not "5.3/10."
        - Say "some micronutrient values appear unusually high and may reflect logging, database, or unit artifacts; verify before acting."
        - For carbohydrates, say "carbohydrate intake should be evaluated relative to training load, recovery, body weight, and goals" instead of giving fixed low gram targets.
