# Current State — Daily Coach Provider Trial Diagnostics v1

Current source of truth: `main` at `a6cd8d0` plus accepted Daily Coach Narrative Provider Trial Matrix tooling at `4641c91`.

Active backend milestone: `Daily Coach Provider Trial Diagnostics v1`.

Status: Architecture approved for Backend implementation.

Diagnostics v1 improves the provider trial matrix only. It adds explicit local raw-provider-output diagnostics, safer OpenAI configuration/error classification, safe provider config metadata, optional Ollama unload cleanup, and artifact-safety guardrails.

Deterministic remains default. `direct_ollama` and `openai` remain opt-in. No product runtime, Streamlit, persistence, parser, validator, quote/value, nutrition, workout, recovery, or report behavior changes are authorized.

Requested final status: `DAILY_COACH_PROVIDER_TRIAL_DIAGNOSTICS_V1_ACCEPTED`.

## Goal

Add repeatable provider trial matrix tooling for Daily Coach value-aware narratives.

The tool compares the same approved Daily Coach contexts across:

- deterministic;
- direct_ollama;
- openai.

The matrix records schema adherence, parse/validation/fallback behavior, quote/value discipline, latency, approved narrative output, rendered narrative output, and manual-review placeholders without changing runtime defaults.

## Implemented direction

Provider evaluation must run through the accepted Daily Coach value-aware narrative path and approved value quote validation path.

Live providers are skipped unless explicitly enabled with `--allow-live-providers`.

Generated artifacts must not include raw provider output or secrets.

The normal app/runtime behavior remains unchanged.

## Scope boundaries

Deterministic remains default.

`direct_ollama` remains opt-in offline/developer mode.

`openai` remains opt-in hosted comparison provider.

No provider default change is authorized.

No live provider calls are allowed in automated tests.

No Streamlit provider controls are added.

No provider narratives are persisted.

No parser, validator, quote/value, nutrition, workout, recovery, report, schema, or persistence behavior is changed.

No snapshots are committed.

## Architecture review step

Return to Architecture after implementation and validation.

Requested final status:

`DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_PROVIDER_TRIAL_MATRIX_V1_ACCEPTED`.

- Daily Coach Async Service Shell / No Worker v1
- Daily Coach Async Provider Runtime Design v1
- qwen3:32b research / future premium async candidate only
- deterministic fallback remains mandatory
- Backend owns facts, validation, persistence, provenance/confidence, and safety boundaries
- AI explains backend-approved truth
- no provider on normal Today page load unless explicitly configured
