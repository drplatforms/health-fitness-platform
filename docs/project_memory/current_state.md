# Current Project State

Last updated: 2026-06-18

## Project

AI Health Coach / fitness-ai

## Current branch

`feature/training-evidence-claim-service`

## Latest accepted milestone

`Nutrition Provider Diagnostic Matrix QA v1`

Runtime safety result: `PASS`; QA result: `FAIL` with failure type `DIAGNOSTIC_CAPTURE_MISSING`. Rejected candidates safely fell back, but diagnostic categories/fields were not exposed in the debug/QA runtime surface.

## Current provisional milestone

`Nutrition Provider Diagnostic Propagation Fix v1` is implemented and pending Architecture review.

## Next recommended milestone after Nutrition Provider Diagnostic Propagation Fix v1

If Architecture accepts this propagation fix, the next recommended milestone is:

`Nutrition Provider Diagnostic Matrix QA Retry v1`

This should rerun users 101-105 through the opt-in Nutrition full-report runtime matrix with qwen2.5:3b and capture safe diagnostic categories/fields from the explicit debug/QA status endpoint for rejected candidates. It should verify diagnostics are still absent from public report text and persisted history. It should not run qwen3 and should not promote Nutrition to Level 5.

## Current model/provider status

- Deterministic path is default and must remain the public-safe baseline.
- `direct_ollama` with `qwen2.5:3b` is the practical supported opt-in model for Training and the isolated Nutrition provider implementation path.
- Nutrition section-only opt-in runtime QA passed with `qwen2.5:3b`.
- Nutrition full-report opt-in runtime QA passed as `PASS_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACK`: provider parsed, validator rejected one candidate, deterministic fallback completed and persisted safely.
- Nutrition full-report runtime matrix passed as `PASS_MATRIX_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACKS`: user 102 provider-approved, users 101/103/104/105 safe-fallback, no failures.
- Nutrition full-report retry matrix passed as `PASS_MATRIX_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACKS`: all seeded users safely fell back; approval quality did not improve.
- Nutrition diagnostic matrix failed with `DIAGNOSTIC_CAPTURE_MISSING`; diagnostic propagation fix now preserves safe categories/fields in debug/QA runtime output only.
- Full-report provider execution is async/background only.
- `qwen3` remains experimental only and is not promoted.
- The old CrewAI full-report coordinator can fail; deterministic fallback composition protects public report output.

## Current section maturity

| Section | Current status | Maturity |
|---|---|---|
| training | Provider-integrated full-report section, opt-in direct_ollama/qwen2.5 path | Level 5 |
| nutrition_target_display | Backend-approved target display contract; input to Nutrition Report Section | Level 2 |
| nutrition_report_section | Backend-owned evidence/claims/fallback boundary plus isolated opt-in provider implementation; full-report runtime matrix/retry matrix accepted with safe fallbacks; diagnostic propagation fix exposes safe category/field telemetry in debug/QA runtime output only; not Level 5 | Level 4 |
| grounded_recommendation | Strong approved contract but cross-domain; not next provider voice section | Level 3 |
| overall_score | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| profile_context | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| biggest_issue | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| likely_cause | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| priority_action | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| best_recommendation | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |

Provider-integrated report sections: `training` only.

## What is safe to build next

- Nutrition Provider Diagnostic Matrix QA Retry v1.
- Rerun users 101-105 full opt-in Nutrition full-report runtime matrix with qwen2.5:3b.
- Capture safe validation diagnostic categories/fields from `/reports/status/{job_id}/debug`.
- Verify diagnostics do not leak into normal `/reports/status/{job_id}`, public report text, or persisted report history.
- Use diagnostic categories to choose the next smallest safe provider-quality improvement.

## What must not be changed casually

- Deterministic default behavior.
- Parser/validator strictness.
- Provider opt-in boundary.
- Report persistence safety boundary.
- Full-report composition fallback boundary.
- Training evidence/claim validator rules.
- Nutrition boundary rule that provider execution and full-report integration remain explicitly config-gated.
- The rule that Training is the only provider-integrated full-report section.
- The debug endpoint clarification: `validation_errors=[]` and `raw_output_preview_truncated=null` are acceptable only in explicit debug endpoint metadata and remain forbidden in public/user-facing/persisted output.

## Expected validation/tests

For docs-only memory/review updates:

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev_commit_check.ps1 -Mode docs-only`
- `git diff --check`
- Verify required docs exist.
- Verify headings are present and accurate.
- Verify no runtime code changed.

For code/tooling changes:

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev_commit_check.ps1 -Mode code`
- Relevant focused tests.
- Full `pytest` when practical.
- No live Ollama calls in pytest.

## Top open risks

1. Context loss across long chat sessions.
2. Accidentally treating qwen3 as promoted or default.
3. Accidentally expanding provider ownership beyond Training.
4. Nutrition full-report runtime safety or matrix safety being mistaken for Level 5 promotion before Architecture approval.
5. Legacy CrewAI coordinator being mistaken for the future full-report voice layer.
6. Generic coaching language degrading product quality even when technically safe.
7. Safe Nutrition provider metadata accidentally leaking raw/debug fields into persisted history during runtime QA or future promotion work.
