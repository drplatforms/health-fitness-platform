AI Health Coach / fitness-ai

## Current branch

`feature/training-evidence-claim-service`

## Latest accepted milestone

`Nutrition Provider Level 5 Promotion Readiness Review v1`

Readiness result: `READY_FOR_NUTRITION_LEVEL_5_PROMOTION_PATCH`. Architecture accepted proceeding to a separate controlled Nutrition Provider Level 5 Promotion v1 patch after Nutrition Provider Approved Suggestion Runtime QA v1 passed with users 101-105 all provider-approved through direct_ollama/qwen2.5:3b.

## Current provisional milestone

`Nutrition Provider Level 5 Promotion v1` is implemented and pending Architecture/QA review.

## Next recommended milestone after Nutrition Provider Level 5 Promotion v1

`Nutrition Level 5 Promotion Runtime QA v1`

QA should rerun users 101-105 through the full-report opt-in Nutrition provider matrix with direct_ollama/qwen2.5:3b, verify `provider_integrated_report_sections` semantics, verify fallback/disabled gates do not falsely imply provider approval, verify Nutrition Target Display remains separate Level 2, and verify public/persisted leakage remains clean.

## Current model/provider status

- Deterministic path is default and must remain the public-safe baseline.
- `direct_ollama` with `qwen2.5:3b` is the practical supported opt-in model for Training and the isolated Nutrition provider implementation path.
- Nutrition section-only opt-in runtime QA passed with `qwen2.5:3b`.
- Nutrition full-report opt-in runtime QA passed as `PASS_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACK`: provider parsed, validator rejected one candidate, deterministic fallback completed and persisted safely.
- Nutrition full-report runtime matrix passed as `PASS_MATRIX_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACKS`: user 102 provider-approved, users 101/103/104/105 safe-fallback, no failures.
- Nutrition full-report retry matrix passed as `PASS_MATRIX_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACKS`: all seeded users safely fell back; approval quality did not improve.
- Nutrition diagnostic matrix retry passed with `PASS_DIAGNOSTICS_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACKS`; diagnostic propagation is working.
- Nutrition practical food focus runtime QA passed with `PASS_WITH_IMPROVED_DIAGNOSTICS`: user 105 is now provider-approved and the no-approved-suggestion path appears fixed.
- Nutrition approved suggestion context inspection/tuning added backend-approved `practical_food_focus` option lists and requires direct-Ollama to copy one exact backend-approved option sentence.
- Nutrition approved suggestion runtime QA passed with `PASS_PROVIDER_APPROVED_MATRIX`: users 101-105 were all provider-approved, practical_food_focus failures dropped to 0, fallback false for all users, and public/persisted leakage checks remained clean.
- Nutrition Provider Level 5 Promotion v1 promotes `nutrition_report_section` to Level 5 provider-integrated status while preserving opt-in gates, deterministic fallback, strict validation, and public/persisted sanitizer boundaries.
- Full-report provider execution is async/background only.
- `qwen3` remains experimental only and is not promoted.
- The old CrewAI full-report coordinator can fail; deterministic fallback composition protects public report output.

## Current section maturity

| Section | Current status | Maturity |
|---|---|---|
| training | Provider-integrated full-report section, opt-in direct_ollama/qwen2.5 path | Level 5 |
| nutrition_target_display | Backend-approved target display contract; input to Nutrition Report Section | Level 2 |
| nutrition_report_section | Provider-integrated full-report section with opt-in direct_ollama/qwen2.5 path, strict parser/validator boundary, backend-approved practical_food_focus options, report-specific provider-integrated metadata, and deterministic fallback | Level 5 |
| grounded_recommendation | Strong approved contract but cross-domain; not next provider voice section | Level 3 |
| overall_score | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| profile_context | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| biggest_issue | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| likely_cause | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| priority_action | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| best_recommendation | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |

Provider-integrated section maturity: `training` and `nutrition_report_section`. Per-report `provider_integrated_report_sections` metadata still lists Nutrition only when approved provider output actually rendered; fallback and disabled-gate Nutrition reports remain explicit.

## What is safe to build next

- Nutrition Level 5 Promotion Runtime QA v1.
- Keep deterministic fallback, provider gates, strict parser/validator behavior, and public/persisted sanitizer boundaries unchanged.
- Verify report-specific provider-integrated metadata for approved, fallback, and disabled-gate Nutrition paths.
- Preserve the distinction between `nutrition_target_display` and `nutrition_report_section`.
- Preserve qwen2.5:3b as the only accepted Nutrition provider model; qwen3 remains experimental only.

## What must not be changed casually

- Deterministic default behavior.
- Parser/validator strictness.
- Provider opt-in boundary.
- Report persistence safety boundary.
- Full-report composition fallback boundary.
- Training evidence/claim validator rules.
- Nutrition boundary rule that provider execution and full-report integration remain explicitly config-gated.
- The rule that provider-integrated metadata must not imply provider-approved Nutrition content when Nutrition falls back or is not attempted.
- The debug endpoint clarification: `validation_errors=[]` and `raw_output_preview_truncated=null` are acceptable only in explicit debug endpoint metadata and remain forbidden in public/user-facing/persisted output.

## Expected validation/tests

For docs-only memory/review updates:

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev_commit_check.ps1 -Mode docs-only`
- `git diff --check`
- Verify required docs exist.
- Verify headings are present and accurate.
- Verify no runtime code changed.

For code/tooling changes:

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev_commit_check.ps1 -Mode code`
- Relevant focused tests.
- Full `pytest` when practical.
- No live Ollama calls in pytest.

## Top open risks

1. Context loss across long chat sessions.
2. Accidentally treating qwen3 as promoted or default.
3. Accidentally expanding provider ownership beyond Training and Nutrition Report Section.
4. Nutrition Level 5 promotion being mistaken for direct_ollama default approval.
5. Promotion semantics accidentally marking fallback or disabled-gate Nutrition reports as provider-approved.
6. Legacy CrewAI coordinator being mistaken for the future full-report voice layer.
7. Generic coaching language degrading product quality even when technically safe.
8. Safe Nutrition provider metadata accidentally leaking raw/debug fields into persisted history during runtime QA or future promotion work.
