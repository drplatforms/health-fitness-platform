# Current Project State

Last updated: 2026-06-20

## Project

AI Health Coach / fitness-ai

## Current source-of-truth branch

`main`

## Current active milestone

`Project Memory Alignment + North Star Architecture v1`

Status: `AUTHORIZED_TO_IMPLEMENT`

Purpose: restore repo project memory as the authoritative continuity layer before the next provider milestone.

North-star references:
- Technical future architecture ledger: `docs/project_memory/future_architecture_ledger.md`
- Premium product/backend blueprint: `docs/project_memory/premium_platform_blueprint.md`

## Latest accepted main baseline

The accepted main baseline before this docs sweep includes:

- Supercharger / session-brief developer tooling
- Catalog Import Pipeline v1
- Catalog Source Evaluation v1
- Food Catalog Import Batch v1
- Exercise Catalog Import Batch v1
- Daily Next Action deterministic service
- Coach's Read / Daily Coach Synthesis
- Today Coach Note deterministic path
- Today UX Polish v1, with global theme cleanup still parked
- Workout Substitution UX v1
- Workout Exercise Count Preference v1
- Workout Daily State Lifecycle v1
- Daily Coach Developer Preview Stabilization v1

The prior same-session approval bridge branch is not accepted and is reference-only.

Daily Coach Provider Preview Contract Reliability v1 is the next provider-reliability lane after this docs alignment branch unless Architecture has already accepted it separately in a later handoff.

## Definition of Done update

Project memory is now a first-class system component.

A feature branch or milestone is not done until the relevant project memory docs reflect:

- what changed
- what did not change
- what is accepted
- what remains parked
- what is explicitly not approved
- what future agents must not assume

Any meaningful commit that changes behavior, architecture boundaries, provider behavior, persistence, routing, UI, tests, accepted status, or project scope must update project memory in the same branch.

Memory drift is architecture drift.

## Current product surfaces

### Today

The Today flow contains distinct surfaces:

- Daily Next Action: deterministic backend decision and CTA.
- Today Coach Note: deterministic, short, user-facing note based on the Daily Next Action.
- Coach's Read / Daily Coach Synthesis: deterministic synthesis surface for broader daily context.
- Daily Grounded Recommendation: deterministic grounded recommendation panel.
- Developer Preview: Daily Coach Narrative: Developer Mode-only manual preview/debug lane.

These surfaces must not be collapsed into each other without Architecture approval.

### Workout

Accepted workout capabilities include:

- improved substitution UX
- Quick / Standard / Full workout size preference
- deterministic count resolution with safe maximum of 7
- daily workout state lifecycle
- stale prior-day selected/active/substituted state expiration or ignore behavior
- completed workout history preservation

### Nutrition and reports

Accepted report provider boundaries include:

- Training Report Section provider path remains opt-in/validated with deterministic fallback.
- Nutrition Report Section is Level 5 provider-integrated on approved opt-in provider output, with deterministic fallback and strict sanitizer boundaries.
- Full-report provider execution remains gated and background-safe where applicable.
- Provider metadata and persistence boundaries remain explicit.

## Current provider doctrine

- Deterministic paths remain the default.
- Backend owns facts, calculations, constraints, validation, persistence, and fallback.
- AI/provider output may explain or phrase backend-approved truth only.
- Validators decide what reaches user-facing display.
- Manual Developer Mode preview lanes are allowed only when scoped.
- No provider may run on normal Today page load unless explicitly approved later.
- `qwen3:8b`, `qwen3:14b`, `qwen3:30b-a3b`, and `qwen3:32b` are not production-promoted.
- `qwen3:32b` remains a future premium coach candidate only.
- No raw or rejected provider output may appear in normal UI.
- No provider narrative persistence is approved for Daily Coach.

## Current Daily Coach provider status

Accepted:

- Daily Coach Narrative Context Builder v1
- Daily Coach Narrative Offline Provider QA v1
- Daily Coach Narrative Provider Contract Tightening v1.1
- Daily Coach Narrative Developer Preview v1
- Daily Coach Narrative Today Developer Panel v1
- Daily Coach Developer Preview Stabilization v1

Not accepted:

- `feature/daily-coach-narrative-same-session-approved-preview-bridge-v1`

Reference-only branch reason:

- attempted same-session approval before the developer-preview and provider-preview diagnostics were stable enough
- exposed Streamlit Developer Mode diagnostics fragility
- exposed provider preview contract reliability gaps
- not merged
- replaced by the stabilization then provider-contract-reliability sequence

## Current catalog status

The catalog foundation is accepted for the current phase:

- Catalog Import Pipeline v1: accepted deterministic staged import tooling.
- Catalog Source Evaluation v1: accepted approved small-batch source candidates.
- Food Catalog Import Batch v1: accepted first 20 reviewed USDA/FDC generic food rows.
- Exercise Catalog Import Batch v1: accepted first 18 manually curated home-equipment exercise rows.

No new catalog import, scraping, external API ingestion, or AI-generated catalog truth is approved unless a future milestone explicitly authorizes it.

## Current section maturity

| Area | Current accepted status |
|---|---|
| training report section | Provider-integrated, opt-in, validated, deterministic fallback protected |
| nutrition report section | Level 5 provider-integrated on approved opt-in provider output; deterministic fallback protected |
| nutrition target display | Backend-approved display contract, not provider-authored truth |
| daily next action | Deterministic decision service |
| today coach note | Deterministic normal Today UI card |
| coach's read / daily coach synthesis | Deterministic synthesis surface |
| daily coach narrative developer preview | Manual Developer Mode preview/debug only |
| daily coach same-session approval | Not accepted; reference-only failed branch |
| workout planning | Deterministic generation with size preference and lifecycle cleanup |
| catalogs | Deterministic curated/imported canonical food and exercise foundations |

## Safe next sequence

1. Complete Project Memory Alignment + North Star Architecture v1.
2. Resume or accept Daily Coach Provider Preview Contract Reliability v1 only after docs are aligned.
3. Retry Daily Coach Same-Session Approved Preview Bridge only after provider preview contract reliability is proven manually and by tests.
4. Keep Global Visual Theme Cleanup v1 parked as non-blocking UI polish.

## Non-negotiable constraints

- no model promotion without QA matrix and Architecture acceptance
- no same-session approval unless explicitly reauthorized after reliability work
- no Daily Coach narrative persistence yet
- no provider call on normal Today load
- no raw/rejected provider output in normal UI
- no schema/persistence/report changes without explicit milestone scope
- no RAG/vector/MoE/MCP/frontend rewrite implementation during docs alignment
- no Aider unless explicitly reapproved
- no Headroom reintroduction
- no Claude workflow
- no `CLAUDE.md`
- `qa_artifacts/` remains local-only and uncommitted
