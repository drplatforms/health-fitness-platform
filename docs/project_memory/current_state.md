# Current State — Daily Coach Provider Prompt Lab / Voice Lab v1

Current source of truth: `main` at `2835d09 Merge daily coach plainspoken voice action clarity v5`.

Active backend milestone: `Daily Coach Provider Prompt Lab / Voice Lab v1`.

Status: Architecture approved for Backend implementation.

V5 technically passed infrastructure but failed product voice. The current milestone is developer-only Prompt Lab / Voice Lab tooling, not another one-off phrase-hardening patch.

The lab compares fixed scenario cases and prompt/context variants through the existing Daily Coach provider path, parser, validator, fallback boundary, sanitized artifacts, and manual scoring template.

Deterministic remains default. OpenAI/direct_ollama remain explicit opt-in/evaluation-only. Normal Today behavior, product persistence, Streamlit provider controls, parser rules, quote/value validation, and fallback behavior remain unchanged.

Requested final status: `DAILY_COACH_PROVIDER_PROMPT_LAB_VOICE_LAB_V1_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`.

# Current State — Daily Coach Provider Plainspoken Voice & Action Clarity v5

Current source of truth: `feature/daily-coach-provider-human-voice-food-action-specificity-v4` at `0ace3da`.

Active backend milestone: `Daily Coach Provider Plainspoken Voice & Action Clarity v5`.

Architecture status: approved for Backend implementation after the green v4 baseline snapshot.

Status: backend implementation patch ready for local validation.

V5 replaces phrase-ban-only tuning with a plainspoken coaching contract. The Daily Coach should say the actual action, use friendly food labels, explain the food reason, connect recovery to training behavior, and keep the priority action concrete without motivational packaging or backend/framework language.

Implemented direction:

- plainspoken voice contract and rejected phrase registry;
- `food_action_context` with friendly food options, macro reason, and backed food-action sentence patterns;
- prompt rewrite around plain examples and anti-examples;
- stronger visible-output validation for user-rejected phrases, canonical food leakage, unbacked food action, invented timing, invented pairings, and invented serving labels;
- trial-matrix v5 diagnostics for plainspoken phrase flags, food-gap reason use, food condition use, slogan-like phrases, and manual product voice scoring.

Boundaries remain unchanged: deterministic is default; OpenAI/direct_ollama remain opt-in/evaluation-only; provider output is parsed, quote/value validated, approved, or deterministically fallen back; no raw provider output is public; no provider output persistence, Streamlit provider controls, nutrition/workout/recovery/report changes, RAG, Prompt Lab, embeddings, or multi-agent orchestration are included.

Requested final status: `DAILY_COACH_PROVIDER_PLAINSPOKEN_VOICE_ACTION_CLARITY_V5_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`.

# Current State — Daily Coach Provider Voice, Context Freedom & Rich Synthesis v3

Current source of truth: `feature/daily-coach-context-selection-coaching-synthesis-v2` at `2cd7708`.

Active backend milestone: `Daily Coach Provider Voice, Context Freedom & Rich Synthesis v3`.

Architecture status: approved for Backend implementation.

Status: backend implementation patch ready for local validation.

V3 addresses product-copy quality after v2 technical pass by giving providers a more natural, human-readable, claim-backed context starter while preserving strict backend truth boundaries. The implementation adds `approved_context_brief`, `claim_backing_map`, cleaned today_story phrasing, natural voice examples/anti-examples, explicit `verbosity_budget`, hard/diagnostic phrase checks, and v3 trial-matrix diagnostics.

Boundaries remain unchanged: deterministic is default; OpenAI/direct_ollama remain opt-in/evaluation-only; provider output is parsed, quote/value validated, approved, or deterministically fallen back; no raw provider output is public; no provider output persistence, Streamlit provider controls, nutrition/workout/recovery/report changes, RAG, Prompt Lab, embeddings, or multi-agent orchestration are included.

# Current State — Daily Coach Provider Context Selection & Coaching Synthesis v2

Current source of truth: accepted copy-grounding branch baseline at `2bbffdb`.

Active backend milestone: `Daily Coach Provider Context Selection & Coaching Synthesis v2`.

Architecture status: approved for Backend implementation.

Status: backend implementation complete pending validation/handoff.

This milestone improves provider context selection and coaching synthesis by adding deterministic `today_story`, expanded high-value claim selection, field-specific claim budgets, adaptive verbosity guidance, prompt synthesis framing, and v2 trial-matrix diagnostics.

Adaptive verbosity rule: the target is useful, grounded, scannable coaching, not maximum brevity. More words are allowed only when approved context is rich and the extra words improve actionability, connect multiple domains, or explain food/training/recovery context clearly. Shorter copy is required when context is sparse, generic, report-like, repetitive, or unsupported.

Boundaries remain unchanged: deterministic is default; OpenAI/direct_ollama are opt-in; provider output is parsed, quote/value validated, approved, or deterministically fallen back; no raw provider output is public; no provider output persistence, Streamlit provider controls, nutrition/workout/recovery/report changes, RAG, Prompt Lab, embeddings, or multi-agent orchestration are included.

Requested final status: `DAILY_COACH_PROVIDER_CONTEXT_SELECTION_COACHING_SYNTHESIS_V2_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`.

# Current State — Daily Coach Provider Copy Grounding & Approved Context Enrichment v1

Current source of truth: `main` / accepted runtime-fix baseline at `60fe77b`.

Active backend milestone: `Daily Coach Provider Copy Grounding & Approved Context Enrichment v1`.

Architecture status: approved for Backend implementation.

Status: backend implementation complete pending validation/handoff.

This milestone enriches provider-approved context packaging and prompt guidance so OpenAI can write more specific Daily Coach copy without weakening the existing parser, quote/value validator, fallback path, or deterministic default.

Implemented direction:

- approved value claim metadata: `priority`, `section_hint`, `coaching_use`, `display_hint`, `value_style`;
- provider context packaging: `provider_task_context`, `high_value_claims`, `preferred_claims_by_field`, `claim_usage_rules`, `field_role_guidance`;
- prompt/field-role guidance for practical coach copy using 2-4 high-value claims;
- trial-matrix copy-quality diagnostics and manual review placeholders.

Boundaries remain unchanged: deterministic is default; OpenAI/direct_ollama are opt-in; provider output is parsed, quote/value validated, approved, or deterministically fallen back; no raw provider output is public; no provider output persistence, Streamlit provider controls, nutrition/workout/recovery/report changes, RAG, Prompt Lab, or multi-agent orchestration are included.

Requested final status: `DAILY_COACH_PROVIDER_COPY_GROUNDING_APPROVED_CONTEXT_ENRICHMENT_V1_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`.

# Current State — Daily Coach Provider Trial Diagnostics v1

Current source of truth: `main` at `a6cd8d0` plus accepted Daily Coach Narrative Provider Trial Matrix tooling at `4641c91`.

Active backend milestone: `Daily Coach Provider Trial Diagnostics v1`.

Status: Architecture approved for Backend implementation.

Diagnostics v1 improves the provider trial matrix only. It adds explicit local raw-provider-output diagnostics, safer OpenAI configuration/error classification, safe provider config metadata, optional Ollama unload cleanup, and artifact-safety guardrails.

Deterministic remains default. `direct_ollama` and `openai` remain opt-in. No product runtime, Streamlit, persistence, parser, validator, quote/value, nutrition, workout, recovery, or report behavior changes are authorized.

Requested final status: `DAILY_COACH_PROVIDER_TRIAL_DIAGNOSTICS_V1_ACCEPTED`.

Commit-check mode: code.

QA class: CLASS 2 / CLASS 5 HYBRID.

Status: backend implementation in progress.

Requested final status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_PROVIDER_TRIAL_MATRIX_V1_ACCEPTED`.

## Goal

Add repeatable provider trial matrix tooling for Daily Coach value-aware narratives.

The tool compares the same approved Daily Coach contexts across:

- deterministic;
- direct_ollama;
- openai.

The matrix records schema adherence, parse/validation/fallback behavior, quote/value discipline, latency, approved narrative output, rendered narrative output, and manual-review placeholders without changing runtime defaults.

## Implemented direction

Provider evaluation must run through the accepted Daily Coach value-aware narrative path and approved value quote validation path.

Live providers are skipped unless explicitly enabled with `--allow-live-providers`.

Generated artifacts must not include raw provider output or secrets.

The normal app/runtime behavior remains unchanged.

## Scope boundaries

Deterministic remains default.

`direct_ollama` remains opt-in offline/developer mode.

`openai` remains opt-in hosted comparison provider.

No provider default change is authorized.

No live provider calls are allowed in automated tests.

No Streamlit provider controls are added.

No provider narratives are persisted.

No parser, validator, quote/value, nutrition, workout, recovery, report, schema, or persistence behavior is changed.

No snapshots are committed.

## Architecture review step

Return to Architecture after implementation and validation.

Requested final status:

`DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_PROVIDER_TRIAL_MATRIX_V1_ACCEPTED`.

# Current Implementation Update — Daily Coach Provider Human Voice & Food Action Specificity v4

Status: Backend v4 patch candidate built from v3 baseline `e23a435`.

This milestone addresses the v3 product-copy failure after technical validation passed. It improves provider-facing human voice and food action specificity while preserving strict backend truth boundaries.

Implemented direction:

- friendly food labels are generated for provider/user-facing copy;
- canonical food labels remain traceability/debug context;
- serving display remains conservative and backend-approved only;
- nutrition_action_context explains the approved food action without letting the model invent meal plans;
- claim_backing_map separates internal meaning from user-facing phrase examples;
- approved_context_brief and today_story avoid known awkward framework phrases;
- prompt examples now directly ban the phrases rejected in QA/user critique;
- validation catches canonical food label leakage, unquoted friendly foods, invented serving wording, and repeatedly rejected phrases;
- trial matrix diagnostics include v4 food/voice fields.

Boundaries preserved:

- deterministic default unchanged;
- OpenAI/direct_ollama opt-in only;
- parser and quote/value validation remain strict;
- no provider persistence;
- no Streamlit changes;
- no nutrition target, workout, recovery, or report architecture changes.
