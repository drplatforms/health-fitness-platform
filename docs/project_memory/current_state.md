# Current Project State

Last updated: 2026-06-20

## Project

AI Health Coach / fitness-ai

## Current branch

`feature/daily-coach-narrative-limited-today-ui-readiness-v1`

## Latest accepted milestone

`Exercise Catalog Import Batch v1` is accepted.

Final accepted status: `EXERCISE_CATALOG_IMPORT_BATCH_V1_ACCEPTED`.

The catalog foundation is complete enough for the current phase:

- Catalog Import Pipeline v1 is accepted.
- Catalog Source Evaluation v1 is accepted with approved small-batch candidates.
- Food Catalog Import Batch v1 is accepted with 20 reviewed USDA/FDC generic rows.
- Exercise Catalog Import Batch v1 is accepted with 18 manually curated, equipment-aligned exercise rows.

Catalog work should pause unless explicitly reauthorized.

## Current implementation milestone

`Daily Coach Narrative Limited Today UI Readiness v1` is implemented pending review.

Implementation status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_LIMITED_TODAY_UI_READINESS_V1_IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_REVIEW`.

This milestone adds a deterministic `Today???s Coach Note` card to normal Today UI. The card appears immediately after the deterministic Daily Next Action panel, uses backend-owned Daily Next Action as its source, and gives the user short coach-like copy plus a next-action CTA.

The normal Today card is deterministic only. It does not call provider generation, does not persist narrative text, does not display raw/rejected provider output, does not expose model/prompt/debug details, and does not change Daily Next Action selection.

New pieces:

- `DailyCoachTodayCard` display model
- `services/daily_coach_today_card_service.py`
- `GET /daily-coach/{user_id}/today-card`
- Streamlit `Today???s Coach Note` card near the top of Today
- service, route, and Streamlit boundary tests

No nutrition calculations, workout generation, catalog rows, provider defaults, validators, persistence, reports, database schema, or model routing are changed.

## Next recommended milestone options

- Today UX Polish v1 after Daily Coach Narrative Limited Today UI Readiness v1 acceptance.
- Daily Coach Narrative Same-Session Approved Preview Bridge v1 if Architecture wants a controlled same-session provider-preview display path.
- Daily Coach Narrative Async Persistence Design v1 only after the deterministic display path feels right.
- Provider Narrative QA Matrix v2 if Architecture wants broader qwen lane comparison against the new display contract.

---

## Historical project state notes

## Current model/provider status

- Deterministic path is default and must remain the public-safe baseline.
- `direct_ollama` with `qwen2.5:3b` is the practical supported opt-in model for Training and the isolated Nutrition provider implementation path.
- Nutrition section-only opt-in runtime QA passed with `qwen2.5:3b`.
- Nutrition full-report opt-in runtime QA passed as `PASS_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACK`: provider parsed, validator rejected one candidate, deterministic fallback completed and persisted safely.
- Nutrition full-report runtime matrix passed as `PASS_MATRIX_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACKS`: user 102 provider-approved, users 101/103/104/105 safe-fallback, no failures.
- Nutrition full-report retry matrix passed as `PASS_MATRIX_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACKS`: all seeded users safely fell back; approval quality did not improve.
- Nutrition diagnostic matrix retry passed with `PASS_DIAGNOSTICS_WITH_SAFE_FALLBACKS`; diagnostic propagation is working.
- Nutrition practical food focus runtime QA passed with `PASS_WITH_IMPROVED_DIAGNOSTICS`: user 105 is now provider-approved and the no-approved-suggestion path appears fixed.
- Nutrition approved suggestion context inspection/tuning added backend-approved `practical_food_focus` option lists and requires direct-Ollama to copy one exact backend-approved option sentence.
- Nutrition approved suggestion runtime QA passed with `PASS_PROVIDER_APPROVED_MATRIX`: users 101-105 were all provider-approved, practical_food_focus failures dropped to 0, fallback false for all users, and public/persisted leakage checks remained clean.
- Nutrition Provider Level 5 Promotion v1 promoted `nutrition_report_section` to Level 5 provider-integrated status while preserving opt-in gates, deterministic fallback, strict validation, and public/persisted sanitizer boundaries.
- Nutrition Level 5 Promotion Runtime QA v1 passed with users 101-105 all provider-approved at Level 5, `provider_integrated_report_sections=training,nutrition_report_section` on approved provider output, disabled-gate semantics preserved for user 101, and safety/leakage checks clean.
- Nutrition Level 5 Forced-Fallback Runtime QA v1 passed with `PASS_FORCED_FALLBACK_RUNTIME_QA`: users 101-105 forced invalid provider output, validation rejected, deterministic fallback rendered, live model was not called, `provider_integrated_report_sections=training`, leakage checks were clean, and qwen3 was not used.
- Control user 102 passed the normal provider-approved path with forced-invalid mode disabled: `nutrition_section_source=direct_ollama_approved` and `provider_integrated_report_sections=training,nutrition_report_section`.
- Nutrition Level 5 runtime semantics are complete across provider-approved, disabled-gate deterministic, and forced-invalid deterministic fallback paths.
- Full-report provider execution is async/background only.
- `qwen3` remains experimental only and is not promoted.
- The old CrewAI full-report coordinator can fail; deterministic fallback composition protects public report output.

## Current section maturity

| Section | Current status | Maturity |
|---|---|---|
| training | Provider-integrated full-report section, opt-in direct_ollama/qwen2.5 path | Level 5 |
| nutrition_target_display | Backend-approved target display contract; input to Nutrition Report Section | Level 2 |
| nutrition_report_section | Provider-integrated full-report section with opt-in direct_ollama/qwen2.5 path, strict parser/validator boundary, backend-approved practical_food_focus options, report-specific provider-integrated metadata, and deterministic fallback | Level 5 |
| grounded_recommendation | Strong approved contract but cross-domain; not next provider voice section | Level 3 |
| overall_score | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| profile_context | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| biggest_issue | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| likely_cause | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| priority_action | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |
| best_recommendation | Deterministic/coordinator-structured | Level 1 |

Provider-integrated section maturity: `training` and `nutrition_report_section`. Per-report `provider_integrated_report_sections` metadata still lists Nutrition only when approved provider output actually rendered; fallback and disabled-gate Nutrition reports remain explicit.

## What is safe to build next

- Exercise Catalog Expansion v1 Architecture/QA review.
- Logging UX Speed & Friction Reduction v1.
- Bounded Coach Voice Bakeoff v1.
- Daily Coach Narrative v1.
- Nutrition Explanation Value-Aware Copy v1.
- Demo / Deployment Packaging Design v1.
- UI polish / screenshot capture pass.
- GitHub README / portfolio update pass.
- Public claims can now say Nutrition fallback semantics are runtime-validated through a QA-only forced-invalid provider mode, while still clarifying that this mode is not normal user behavior.
- Next provider-quality section milestone.
- Keep deterministic fallback, provider gates, strict parser/validator behavior, and public/persisted sanitizer boundaries unchanged.
- Preserve the distinction between `nutrition_target_display` and `nutrition_report_section`.
- Preserve qwen2.5:3b as the only accepted Nutrition provider model; qwen3 remains experimental only.

## Current product loop direction

Daily Next Action Panel v1 is accepted and merged. The Today page now answers “What should I do today?” with one deterministic backend-owned next action.

Daily Coaching Product Loop v1 connects existing backend-approved state into a practical loop:

```text
recovery check-in
→ current recovery/training/nutrition state
→ nutrition target-vs-actual and logging completeness
→ workout preview / workout execution
→ report guidance
→ one backend-approved next action
```

Daily Next Action Panel v1 is accepted. The deterministic service returns exactly one action from the approved v1 action set, with backend-owned reason and workflow target. The Today page renders this card near the top without exposing raw provider/debug metadata.

Approved v1 action set: Complete recovery check-in, Keep training conservative, Log a meal or snack, Review nutrition target progress, Review today’s workout, Review today’s report guidance.

The panel remains backend-truth-owned. It surfaces one primary action, a short backend-supported reason, and a workflow pointer, but does not allow AI/provider output to invent navigation, food, calorie, macro, workout, fatigue, or recovery claims.

## Current catalog direction

Catalog Expansion & Curation v1 planning was accepted. Food Catalog Expansion v1 is now implemented pending review.

The app can now tell the user to log food or review a workout; the next product-quality bottleneck is whether those actions are easy and useful. Catalog expansion should remain deterministic, curated, inspectable, testable, and backend-owned.

Food Catalog Expansion v1 increases the starter canonical food catalog from 132 to 202 curated entries. The 70-entry expansion covers practical lean proteins, dairy/eggs, grains/starches, legumes, fruits, vegetables, fats/seeds, and simple convenience foods. Existing per-100g nutrient storage, manually curated source policy, Moderate confidence, default grams, aliases, and canonical search/logging behavior are preserved.

Exercise Catalog Expansion v1 remains recommended second to improve workout variety, equipment matching, substitutions, and recovery-aware options.

Do not add RAG, embeddings, scraping, AI-generated production catalog entries, meal planning, unreviewed food dumps, or clinical nutrition claims.



## Current AI provider evaluation direction

Bounded Coach Voice Bakeoff v1 and Coach Voice Contract Tightening v1 are accepted and merged to `main` as offline evaluation milestones.

Current accepted coach voice findings:

- `qwen3:8b` remains the best practical evaluation-only bounded coach voice candidate.
- `qwen3:32b` remains the best offline / chores-mode quality reference, but it is too slow for tight Today UI.
- `qwen2.5:3b` improved to a compliant small baseline after contract tightening, but copy remains more generic.
- `qwen3:14b` partially improved but remains unreliable.
- `qwen3:30b-a3b` remains incompatible with strict JSON-only output.

No model is production-approved. `qwen3` remains not approved. No model may write to Today, Streamlit, reports, production provider paths, next-action selection, food suggestions, exercise suggestions, targets, workouts, recovery status, nutrition claims, or medical claims.

Daily Coach Narrative v1 Planning is the current docs-only bridge from offline bakeoff evidence toward a future bounded daily narrative layer.

Current planned future narrative sequence:

```text
Daily Next Action state
→ DailyCoachNarrativeContext
→ CandidateDailyCoachNarrative JSON attempt
→ narrative parser/validator
→ ApprovedDailyCoachNarrative or deterministic fallback
→ future Developer Mode preview
→ future normal Today UI only after Architecture acceptance
```

Recommended next milestone after planning acceptance: `Daily Coach Narrative Context Builder v1`.

## What must not be changed casually

- Deterministic default behavior.
- Parser/validator strictness.
- Provider opt-in boundary.
- Report persistence safety boundary.
- Full-report composition fallback boundary.
- Training evidence/claim validator rules.
- Nutrition boundary rule that provider execution and full-report integration remain explicitly config-gated.
- The rule that provider-integrated metadata must not imply provider-approved Nutrition content when Nutrition falls back or is not attempted.
- The debug endpoint clarification: `validation_errors=[]` and `raw_output_preview_truncated=null` are acceptable only in explicit debug endpoint metadata and remain forbidden in public/user-facing/persisted output.

## Expected validation/tests

For docs-only memory/review updates:

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev_commit_check.ps1 -Mode docs-only`
- `git diff --check`
- Verify required docs exist.
- Verify headings are present and accurate.
- Verify no runtime code changed.

For code/tooling changes:

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev_commit_check.ps1 -Mode code`
- Relevant focused tests.
- Full `pytest` when practical.
- No live Ollama calls in pytest.

## Top open risks

1. Context loss across long chat sessions.
2. Accidentally treating qwen3 as promoted or default.
3. Accidentally expanding provider ownership beyond Training and Nutrition Report Section.
4. Nutrition Level 5 runtime validation being mistaken for direct_ollama default approval.
5. Future public-facing wording overstating the QA-only forced-invalid mode as normal production behavior.
6. Future changes accidentally marking fallback or disabled-gate Nutrition reports as provider-approved.
7. Legacy CrewAI coordinator being mistaken for the future full-report voice layer.
8. Generic coaching language degrading product quality even when technically safe.
9. Safe Nutrition provider metadata accidentally leaking raw/debug fields into persisted history during future runtime QA or provider work.
10. Catalog expansion becoming an unreviewed dump instead of deterministic curated seed data.
11. Food catalog entries creating false precision through weak source/confidence handling.
12. Exercise catalog expansion changing workout generation behavior before the curation plan is accepted.

## Coach Voice Contract Tightening v1

Coach Voice Contract Tightening v1 is accepted and merged to `main`.

Final accepted status: `COACH_VOICE_CONTRACT_TIGHTENING_V1_ACCEPTED_WITH_MODEL_FINDINGS`.

The tightened prompt/schema packaging improved model compliance across all five accepted context packs while preserving strict validators and production boundaries.

Accepted model findings:

- `qwen3:8b`: 5/5 pass, best practical evaluation-only bounded coach voice candidate, not production-approved.
- `qwen3:32b`: 5/5 pass, best offline / chores-mode quality reference, too slow for tight Today UI, not production-approved.
- `qwen2.5:3b`: 5/5 pass after contract tightening, useful compliant small baseline, still more generic.
- `qwen3:14b`: 2/5 pass, partial improvement, still unreliable.
- `qwen3:30b-a3b`: 0/5 pass, still incompatible with strict JSON-only output.

No model is promoted. qwen3 remains not approved. No Today, Streamlit, report, production provider, catalog, workout generation, nutrition formula, fallback, or provider gate behavior changed.

## Daily Coach Narrative v1 Planning

Daily Coach Narrative v1 Planning is implemented as a docs-only milestone on `feature/daily-coach-narrative-v1-planning` pending Architecture acceptance.

Planning status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_V1_PLANNED_PENDING_ARCHITECTURE_ACCEPTANCE`.

The planned future narrative layer would explain the backend-selected Daily Next Action with compact coach-style language while preserving backend authority over action selection, workflow target, confidence, approved facts, forbidden claims, and fallback behavior.

Proposed future context:

```text
Daily Next Action state
→ DailyCoachNarrativeContext
→ CandidateDailyCoachNarrative JSON attempt
→ narrative parser/validator
→ ApprovedDailyCoachNarrative or deterministic fallback
```

Planning confirms:

- the narrative may explain the approved action but may not choose or change it
- the model owns wording only
- backend owns truth, confidence, approved facts, forbidden claims, validation, and fallback
- output should use the tightened coach voice JSON object unless a later implementation proves a need to specialize it
- failed model output falls back to deterministic Daily Next Action wording
- the first implementation slice should be `Daily Coach Narrative Context Builder v1`, with no model call

Normal Today UI integration remains out of scope until later runtime QA and Architecture acceptance.

## Daily Coach Narrative Context Builder v1

Daily Coach Narrative Context Builder v1 is accepted and merged to `main`.

Final accepted status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_CONTEXT_BUILDER_V1_ACCEPTED`.

Implemented:

- `DailyCoachNarrativeContext` model
- deterministic context builder service
- context validation helper
- focused unit tests
- project memory milestone/review docs

The builder consumes the existing deterministic Daily Next Action result and returns a compact backend-approved context packet for future narrative provider QA. It preserves `next_action_id`, `next_action_title`, `next_action_reason`, `workflow_target`, `priority`, and `severity` exactly. `approved_focus` is exactly the Daily Next Action title.

The builder creates explicit approved facts, approved limitations, forbidden claim categories, and deterministic fallback wording. It filters raw/debug/provider-like evidence keys and does not expose raw logs, raw provider output, raw validation errors, raw debug payloads, full catalog dumps, or unfiltered history.

No model is called. No qwen, Ollama, direct_ollama, or CrewAI path is introduced. No Today/Streamlit/report integration occurs in this slice.

## Daily Coach Narrative Offline Provider QA v1

Daily Coach Narrative Offline Provider QA v1 is accepted with model findings.

Final accepted status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_OFFLINE_PROVIDER_QA_V1_ACCEPTED_WITH_MODEL_FINDINGS`.

Implemented:

- Daily Coach Narrative provider/offline QA service
- Daily Coach Narrative validation service
- offline QA CLI tool
- focused parser/validator/provider tests
- runtime QA project memory docs

The offline QA path builds `DailyCoachNarrativeContext` for selected users, sends only approved context fields to the model, parses the tightened six-key JSON output contract, validates recommended focus and approved facts, blocks forbidden claims, records local QA artifacts, and keeps deterministic fallback behavior available.

Runtime findings:

- `qwen3:8b`: clean practical pass across users 101, 102, and 105; parse/validation/decision 3/3; grounding 5; voice 4; latency roughly 39-52 seconds; best practical Daily Coach Narrative evaluation candidate; not production-approved.
- `qwen2.5:3b`: safe compliance pass across users 101, 102, and 105; parse/validation/decision 3/3; useful small baseline but produced meta/process language such as "Use the exact approved focus because the backend-approved facts support it"; not recommended for developer preview voice without validator tightening.
- `qwen3:32b`: partial offline reference pass; users 102 and 105 passed, user 101 timed out at roughly 300 seconds; useful quality reference but too slow and timeout-prone for practical preview loops.

Validator gap identified:

- Product-copy validation must reject meta/process/internal architecture language before any Developer Preview surface displays provider narrative.

No normal Today UI integration occurred. No Streamlit integration occurred. No report integration occurred. No model output is persisted. No model is promoted. qwen3 remains not approved. direct_ollama remains opt-in only.

Recommended next milestone: `Daily Coach Narrative Provider Contract Tightening v1.1`.

## Daily Coach Narrative Provider Contract Tightening v1.1

Daily Coach Narrative Provider Contract Tightening v1.1 is implemented pending QA/runtime review.

Implementation status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_PROVIDER_CONTRACT_TIGHTENING_V1_1_IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_QA`.

This milestone tightens Daily Coach Narrative product-copy validation after runtime QA identified safe but unacceptable meta/process copy from `qwen2.5:3b`.

Implemented behavior:

- rejects meta/process/internal architecture language in `coach_note`, `key_takeaway`, `confidence_language`, and `avoided_claims`
- rejects phrases and close variants such as `approved facts`, `backend-approved`, `exact approved focus`, `use the exact`, `provided context`, `as instructed`, `JSON`, `schema`, `validator`, `provider output`, `workflow target`, and `deterministic fallback`
- preserves exact `recommended_focus` validation
- preserves exact `used_approved_facts` validation
- preserves forbidden-claim, invented-number, invented-food/target, changed-action, and changed-workflow-target rejection
- keeps normal qwen3-style coach copy valid when it stays grounded in the approved context

The offline provider prompt example was cleaned up to avoid demonstrating rejected process language.

No normal Today UI integration occurred. No Streamlit integration occurred. No report integration occurred. No model output is persisted. No model is promoted. qwen3 remains not approved. direct_ollama remains opt-in only.

Required runtime QA:

```powershell
python tools\daily_coach_narrative_offline_qa.py --model qwen3:8b --model qwen2.5:3b --user-id 101 --user-id 102 --user-id 105
```

Recommended next milestone after acceptance: `Daily Coach Narrative Developer Preview v1`.

## Daily Coach Narrative Provider Contract Tightening v1.1 Runtime Fix

Daily Coach Narrative Provider Contract Tightening v1.1 Runtime Fix is implemented pending local/runtime QA.

Implementation status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_PROVIDER_CONTRACT_TIGHTENING_V1_1_RUNTIME_FIX_IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_QA`.

Runtime QA after the first v1.1 implementation showed a useful but unsatisfactory result: the validator correctly rejected meta/process/internal language, but provider copy still produced too much internal phrasing and one qwen3:8b run cited a non-exact confidence fact.

This runtime-fix patch keeps the validator strict and does not loosen action, workflow target, fact, forbidden-claim, or invented-number validation.

Implemented runtime-fix behavior:

- field-specific meta/internal rejection diagnostics now identify the user-facing field that failed
- meta/internal language checks apply to coach-facing generated fields: `coach_note`, `key_takeaway`, and `confidence_language`
- `avoided_claims` remains an offline audit field and no longer causes product-copy rejection by itself
- raw/debug/provider metadata checks now scan coach-facing generated fields instead of offline audit fields
- provider prompt labels were rewritten away from `APPROVED_CONTEXT`, `APPROVED_FACTS`, backend wording, and workflow-target exposure
- provider prompt now uses coach-facing labels such as `SELECTED_ACTION_CONTEXT`, `FOCUS_TO_COPY_EXACTLY`, and `FACT_STRINGS_FOR_USED_FACTS`
- provider-facing fact strings exclude workflow target route internals
- confidence language produced by the context builder no longer uses backend-approved/internal phrasing
- exact `used_approved_facts` validation remains strict; paraphrases such as `Nutritional confidence: Limited` remain rejected unless that exact string appears in the approved fact list

No normal Today UI integration occurred. No Streamlit integration occurred. No report integration occurred. No model output is persisted. No model is promoted. qwen3 remains not approved. direct_ollama remains opt-in only.

Required runtime QA remains:

```powershell
python tools\daily_coach_narrative_offline_qa.py --model qwen3:8b --model qwen2.5:3b --user-id 101 --user-id 102 --user-id 105
```

## Daily Coach Narrative Provider Contract Tightening v1.1 Closeout

Daily Coach Narrative Provider Contract Tightening v1.1 is accepted and merged to `main`.

Final accepted status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_PROVIDER_CONTRACT_TIGHTENING_V1_1_ACCEPTED`.

Runtime QA after citation/action focus tightening produced a clean pass across `qwen3:8b`, `qwen2.5:3b`, and `qwen3:32b` for users 101, 102, and 105.

Accepted model findings:

- `qwen3:8b`: best practical evaluation candidate; not production-approved.
- `qwen2.5:3b`: safe small compliant baseline; less polished; not production-approved.
- `qwen3:32b`: useful offline reference; too slow for practical preview loops; not production-approved.

No model is production-approved. qwen3 remains not approved for production. direct_ollama remains opt-in only.

## Daily Coach Narrative Developer Preview v1

Daily Coach Narrative Developer Preview v1 is implemented pending local/runtime QA.

Implementation status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_DEVELOPER_PREVIEW_V1_IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_QA`.

Implemented:

- `DailyCoachNarrativePreviewResult` public-safe preview model
- `services/daily_coach_narrative_preview_service.py`
- developer-only backend debug route: `GET /daily-coach/{user_id}/narrative-preview/debug`
- focused preview service tests
- focused preview route tests
- project memory milestone/review/runtime QA docs

The preview endpoint defaults to deterministic fallback and does not call a provider unless explicitly requested with `provider=direct_ollama`.

Provider output is returned only after existing Daily Coach Narrative parser and validator rules pass. Unparsable, rejected, timed out, or unavailable provider output falls back deterministically.

Public-safe fallback reasons are limited to:

- `provider_disabled`
- `provider_timeout`
- `provider_parse_failed`
- `provider_validation_failed`
- `provider_unavailable`

The preview payload intentionally excludes rejected provider text, raw model output, raw prompts, raw provider payloads, raw validation errors, validation internals, stack traces, model-facing schema text, and source metadata.

No normal Today UI integration occurs. No Streamlit normal surface integration occurs. No report integration occurs. No model-generated narrative is persisted. No model is promoted. qwen3 remains not production-approved. direct_ollama remains opt-in only.

Recommended local runtime QA:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://localhost:8000/daily-coach/102/narrative-preview/debug"
Invoke-RestMethod "http://localhost:8000/daily-coach/102/narrative-preview/debug?provider=direct_ollama&model=qwen3:8b&date=2026-06-19&timeout_seconds=180"
```


## Daily Coach Narrative Developer Preview v1 Closeout

Daily Coach Narrative Developer Preview v1 is accepted and merged to `main`.

Final accepted status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_DEVELOPER_PREVIEW_V1_ACCEPTED`.

Accepted endpoint:

```text
GET /daily-coach/{user_id}/narrative-preview/debug
```

Accepted behavior:

- deterministic fallback by default
- explicit `direct_ollama` provider opt-in only
- approved narrative returned only after parse + validation success
- fallback returned on provider disabled, unavailable, timed out, parse-failed, or validation-failed paths
- rejected provider text and raw internals are not exposed

Accepted model findings:

- `qwen3:8b`: developer-preview approved as evaluation candidate only; not production-approved.
- `qwen2.5:3b`: developer-preview baseline only; not production-approved.
- `qwen3:32b`: optional offline/debug reference only due to latency; not production-approved.

Normal Today UI integration remains not approved.

## Daily Coach Narrative Async Today Preview Design v1

Daily Coach Narrative Async Today Preview Design v1 is complete and ready for Architecture review.

Implementation status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_ASYNC_TODAY_PREVIEW_DESIGN_V1_COMPLETE`.

Design artifacts:

- `docs/project_memory/architecture/daily_coach_narrative_async_today_preview_v1.md`
- `docs/project_memory/milestones/daily_coach_narrative_async_today_preview_design_v1.md`
- `docs/project_memory/reviews/daily_coach_narrative_product_readiness_review_v1.md`

Design decision:

- Do not block Today on qwen3:8b.
- Do not proceed directly to normal Today UI integration.
- Today must load deterministic fallback immediately.
- First Today-adjacent implementation should be manual and developer-gated.
- Provider output may display only after parse + validation success.
- Failed provider output keeps deterministic fallback.
- No provider narrative is persisted as user-facing history in the first Today preview.

Recommended next implementation after acceptance: `Daily Coach Narrative Today Developer Panel v1`.

## Daily Coach Narrative Multi-Tier Async Today Preview Design v1 Addendum

Architecture accepted the docs-only async Today preview design with a required multi-tier model-lane addendum.

Revised accepted status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_MULTI_TIER_ASYNC_TODAY_PREVIEW_DESIGN_V1_ACCEPTED_WITH_ADDENDUM`.

The design now explicitly supports four lanes:

- deterministic fallback: immediate/default Today-safe lane with no provider call
- `qwen3:8b`: fast developer-preview lane for practical runtime QA and lower-latency experimentation
- `qwen3:32b`: premium-quality developer-preview lane for manual long-running generation and future better-hardware/precompute exploration
- `qwen2.5:3b`: small baseline/regression lane for compliance and validator sanity checks

The next implementation should be `Daily Coach Narrative Today Developer Panel v1` with a model-lane selector from the beginning. It must not be implemented as `qwen3:8b` only.

Boundaries remain unchanged: no normal Today UI integration, no synchronous provider call from Today, no automatic background generation, no persistence/cache, no report integration, no model promotion, no direct_ollama default change, no validator loosening, and no deterministic fallback weakening.

## Daily Coach Narrative Today Developer Panel v1

Daily Coach Narrative Today Developer Panel v1 is implemented pending QA.

Implementation status: `DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_TODAY_DEVELOPER_PANEL_V1_IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_QA`.

Implemented:

- Streamlit Developer Mode-only panel: `Developer Preview: Daily Coach Narrative`
- manual model-lane selector with all accepted lanes
- deterministic fallback lane
- `qwen3:8b` fast preview lane
- `qwen3:32b` premium preview lane
- `qwen2.5:3b` baseline/regression lane
- manual trigger only
- fallback-first display
- approved provider narrative display only when backend parse + validation pass
- curated public-safe status and context summary

The panel uses the accepted backend debug endpoint:

```text
GET /daily-coach/{user_id}/narrative-preview/debug
```

No normal Today UI integration occurs. The panel is hidden when Developer Mode is disabled. No provider generation happens automatically on normal Today page load. No report integration, persistence, model promotion, provider default change, validator change, or deterministic fallback weakening is introduced.
