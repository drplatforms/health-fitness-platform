# Next Milestone — Architecture Review for Workout Generation + Today Workout View v0

This next milestone should be selected only after Workout Generation + Today Workout View v0 is reviewed by Architecture.

Current implementation milestone before this next step:

```text
Workout Generation + Today Workout View v0
```

Current implementation baseline:

```text

```

Likely next owner:

```text
Architecture
```

```

Recommended next sequence:

```text
1. Architecture reviews Workout Generation + Today Workout View v0 implementation evidence.
2. If accepted, Architecture chooses the next narrow daily-driver workout interaction slice.
3. Future frontend work should stay backend-contract-driven and should not duplicate workout generation or planning logic.
```

auth
hosting
sync
backend contract rewrites
workout logging
nutrition logging
provider expansion
OpenAI/Ollama/CrewAI behavior changes

```text
1. Backend completes the developer-only GPT-family/OpenAI trial tooling and reports validation evidence.
2. Architecture reviews raw trial outputs, if any real OpenAI smoke was run.
3. Architecture decides whether to continue prompt iteration, run additional model comparisons, or route a separate product-integration design.

Recommended next sequence:

```text
1. Architecture reviews Daily Coach Human Voice Prompt Contract v1 implementation evidence.
2. If accepted, Architecture may authorize a manual prompt QA/trial milestone using the developer-only runner.
3. Any later provider-product integration must remain separately scoped and must not reuse the rejected runtime-spike prompt path.
```

# Next Milestone — Architecture Selection After Daily Coach Provider Preview Raw Data Payload v1

This next milestone should be selected only after Daily Coach Provider Preview Raw Data Payload v1 is accepted, merged to `main`, pushed, and snapshotted.

Current implementation milestone before this next step:

```

Likely next owner:

```text
Architecture
```

Likely next purpose:

```text
Review whether the developer-only raw data payload is sufficient as the future provider-preview input surface before authorizing any provider call, provider prompt, or Daily Coach Note copy generation work.
```

Recommended next sequence:

```text
1. Architecture reviews Daily Coach Provider Preview Raw Data Payload v1 evidence.
2. QA verifies the payload is developer-only, read-only, source-labeled, and free of final-copy/sentence-bank fields.
3. Architecture decides whether to authorize a later provider-preview prompt/runtime slice, a payload inspection slice, or another source-data enrichment slice.
```

Future provider voice reminder:

```text
Future provider work should receive raw deterministic backend data, source facts, confidence, limitations, recovery/training/nutrition indicators, and user context. It should not be forced into backend-authored sentence banks or only backend-written prose summaries.
```

Review whether Daily Coach Note public-copy evaluation coverage is sufficient, then choose the next narrow Daily Coach Note or provider-preview slice.
```

Recommended next sequence:

```text
1. Architecture reviews Daily Coach Note Copy QA Matrix v1 evidence.
2. QA verifies deterministic Today card copy remains safe, bounded, backward compatible, and unchanged without a supplied recovery contract.
3. Architecture decides whether to authorize broader Daily Coach Note integration, provider-preview copy experimentation, or another documentation/QA hardening slice.
```

Future provider voice reminder:

```text
Future provider work should receive raw deterministic backend data, source facts, confidence, limitations, recovery/training/nutrition indicators, and user context. It should not be forced into backend-authored sentence banks or only backend-written prose summaries.

# Next Milestone — Recovery Intelligence v2 Service v1

This next milestone is recommended only after Recovery Intelligence v2 Model Contract v1 is accepted, merged to `main`, pushed, and snapshotted.

Current implementation milestone before this next step:

```

Planning source:

```text
docs/project_memory/architecture/recovery_intelligence_v2_plan.md
```

Likely next owner:

```text
Backend Development
```

Likely next purpose:

```text
Implement a read-only Recovery Intelligence v2 service that builds the accepted v2 model contract from daily_checkins without changing Daily Coach output, provider behavior, API, UI, schema, or recommendation behavior.
```

Likely future deliverables:

```text
services/recovery_intelligence_v2_service.py
tests/test_recovery_intelligence_v2_service.py
```

Expected future service behavior:

- read from `daily_checkins`
- preserve `checkin_date` as the primary date
- dedupe duplicate same-day check-ins by latest `created_at` / `id`
- construct current-day context, baseline, recent-vs-baseline delta, recent-vs-prior delta, data quality, and indicator interpretations
- keep missing values explicit as unknown / `None`
- expose provenance/source facts
- preserve confidence, reason codes, and limitations
- block medical, diagnostic, injury, illness, sleep-disorder, overtraining, forced-deload, or prescriptive treatment language

Non-goals for the next service slice unless Architecture explicitly expands scope:

```text
Daily Coach Note integration
API changes
Streamlit changes
database/schema changes
provider behavior changes
OpenAI/Ollama/CrewAI changes
recommendation behavior changes
report behavior changes

```

After the service is accepted, a separate later milestone may consider Daily Coach Intelligence Snapshot Recovery v2 integration.
