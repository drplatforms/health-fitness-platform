# Daily Coach Natural Draft + Claim Audit Contract v1

Status: Active Backend implementation contract.

## Purpose

Daily Coach Natural Draft + Claim Audit v1 changes the provider experiment from a constrained writer into a freer writer with a stricter backend reviewer.

The core rule is:

Loosen the writer. Tighten the reviewer.

## Developer-only boundary

This workflow is developer-only. It does not replace normal Today behavior, does not promote OpenAI, and does not persist provider output into product data.

## Flow

ApprovedCoachBrief
→ natural coach draft
→ deterministic claim extraction
→ backend claim audit
→ one targeted repair attempt when safe
→ re-audit
→ final approved copy or deterministic fallback

## Backend authority

Backend remains final authority for facts, interpretations, claim registry, audit rules, repair limits, fallback, and approval.

## Writer authority

The writer may only draft natural copy from the ApprovedCoachBrief. It may not invent facts, foods, serving sizes, timing, targets, causality, medical claims, or user data.

## Claim audit

V1 audits high-risk claims including food identity, macro status, serving amount, timing, training intensity, recovery interpretation, causal language, addressing, medical/body claims, and judgment/motivation claims.

## Repair policy

One repair attempt is allowed. Repair output must be re-extracted and re-audited. Failed repair falls back deterministically.

## Artifacts

Default artifacts are sanitized and developer-only. They must not include raw provider output, secrets, env dumps, chain-of-thought, database rows, runtime feedback JSONL, qa_artifacts, snapshots, patch files, or apply scripts.
