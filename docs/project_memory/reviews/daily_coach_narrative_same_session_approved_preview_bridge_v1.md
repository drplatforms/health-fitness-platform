# Daily Coach Narrative Same-Session Approved Preview Bridge v1 Review

Proposed final status: DAILY_COACH_NARRATIVE_SAME_SESSION_APPROVED_PREVIEW_BRIDGE_V1_ACCEPTED

## Summary

Implemented a session-only approval bridge between developer-gated provider preview and the Today Coach Note card.

The implementation allows a validated preview to be explicitly approved for the active Streamlit session. The approved provider text can replace only the coach note body while deterministic backend-owned facts remain authoritative.

## Implementation

- Added `services/daily_coach_same_session_approval_service.py`.
- Added explicit eligibility checks for parse success, validation success, approved narrative presence, no-leak display text, same user, same date, and same action/workflow context.
- Added Streamlit session-state storage for the approved preview.
- Added Developer Mode approval and revert controls.
- Kept normal Today card route deterministic.
- Added service and UI/source tests for approval, rejection, no-provider-call, no-persistence, and no-leak boundaries.

## Validation focus

- valid preview can be approved for same session
- rejected preview cannot be approved
- raw/debug/provider terms cannot appear in normal card text
- approval mismatch is ignored/cleared
- approval is session-state only
- normal Today card does not call provider preview

## Deferred

- provider promotion
- async provider generation
- narrative persistence
- cache/persistence design
- model QA matrix expansion
