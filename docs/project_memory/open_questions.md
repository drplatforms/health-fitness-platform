# Open Questions — Daily Coach Provider Copy Grounding & Approved Context Enrichment v1

## Active

1. After context enrichment, does `gpt-5.5` consistently use 2-4 high-value approved facts for user `102` / `2026-06-27`?
2. Does the enriched prompt reduce generic Daily Coach copy without causing fact dumps?
3. Do local direct_ollama models understand exact approved claim keys better with the enriched prompt?
4. Should diagnostic quality flags eventually become hard failures, or remain trial-matrix review aids?
5. Which claim metadata fields become most useful for future Prompt Lab/manual scoring work?

## Closed for this milestone

- Deterministic remains default.
- OpenAI/direct_ollama remain opt-in.
- Quote/value validation remains mandatory.
- Raw provider output remains local-only diagnostic material.

# Open Questions — Daily Coach Provider Trial Diagnostics v1

## Active

1. After local `.env`/shell loading is confirmed, does OpenAI `gpt-4.1-mini` produce approved Daily Coach value narratives without fallback?
2. Do local direct_ollama models keep misusing `quoted_values_used` after prompt/diagnostic review?
3. Which local diagnostic mode is most useful for QA: terminal inspection, local raw-output files outside repo, or both?
4. Which Ollama cleanup option is most reliable on the Windows Ollama host: explicit unload, keep_alive `0`, or both?
5. Should deeper OpenAI response classification eventually move into provider runtime service code if other provider endpoints need it?

## Closed for this milestone

- Deterministic remains default.
- direct_ollama/openai remain opt-in.
- Trial diagnostics must not change normal product runtime behavior.
- Automated tests must not call live providers.

- Does food suggestion usage improve actionability when approved and quote-valid?
- Do field-specific claim budgets correctly flag too-few/too-many claim usage without weakening hard safety validation?
