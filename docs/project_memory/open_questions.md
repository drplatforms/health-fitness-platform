# Open Questions

Last updated: 2026-06-18

## Product voice

- When should qwen3 be re-tested for Training product voice?
- What validator/evidence improvements are needed before qwen3 can safely sound more natural?

## Nutrition

- QA-Only Forced Invalid Provider Mode v1 is implemented pending runtime QA. Does Nutrition Level 5 Forced-Fallback Runtime QA v1 fully close the remaining fallback coverage limitation?
- After forced-fallback runtime QA, should public claims remove the fallback coverage limitation or preserve a narrower note?
- Should Nutrition remain opt-in indefinitely after Level 5 runtime validation, or should a separate future default-provider readiness review be planned?
- What additional non-seeded runtime cases are required after Level 5 promotion, if any?
- What additional negative validator cases are required after observing real qwen2.5 approved output in matrix runtime QA?
- When should Nutrition provider metadata be allowed into persisted full-report history, and at what level of detail?
- Should debug/QA-only Nutrition validation diagnostic categories remain limited to `/reports/status/{job_id}/debug`, or should Architecture define a broader debug-only QA surface later?

## Recovery

- What backend-owned recovery evidence is needed before recovery becomes a provider-ready section?

## Grounded Recommendation

- How should cross-domain recommendations consume approved section claims without becoming a monolithic AI-owned summary?

## Developer workflow

- Should the new Windows validation helper eventually be mirrored with a Linux runtime-QA helper?
