### Daily Coach Fully Free Source-Data Lab v1

Question:

```text
Can GPT-5.5 produce a meaningfully better Daily Coach note from clean organized source data and an extremely small prompt?
```

Answer:

```text
Not enough to justify more same-lane provider voice iteration now.
```

Recorded classification:

```text
DAILY_COACH_FULLY_FREE_SOURCE_DATA_LAB_V1_QA_REVIEWED_NOT_BETTER_THAN_V4_GENERIC_STILL_CONSTRAINED_PROVIDER_PAUSE_RECOMMENDED
```

Conclusion:

- Fully Free Source-Data Lab v1 was technically valid and useful as developer-only evidence.
- It produced completed drafts and valid artifacts.
- It did not meaningfully beat the v4 free-range decaging diagnostic baseline.
- Outputs were competent but generic and structurally repetitive.
- Provider voice iteration is paused.
- The next center of gravity is backend intelligence, not another prompt/provider voice pass.

## Active questions for docs refresh

1. Do `current_state.md`, `project_state.json`, `next_milestone.md`, `open_questions.md`, and current handoffs agree on `23b5378`?
2. Do team-routing docs reflect the exact seven visible team lanes?
3. Are DevOps & Tooling and Portfolio Packaging correctly marked as narrow/low-frequency?
4. Is Backend Intelligence Foundation explicitly established as next center of gravity?
5. Are provider experiments clearly paused?
6. Are big-tech items parked behind backend intelligence?
7. Can a new Architecture/Backend/QA chat onboard in under 5 minutes from repo docs?

## Active architecture follow-up after docs refresh

```text
Backend Intelligence Foundation v1
```

Key design questions:

- What facts should Recovery Intelligence compute deterministically before provider synthesis?
- What set-level workout evidence should Workout Set Intelligence expose?
- What trends should the Trend Engine compute before any retrieval/orchestration work?
- What six-month seed data is needed for realistic coach intelligence evaluation?
- What curated food knowledge is needed before expanding food/snack advice?

## Historical open-question notes

The sections below are historical unless promoted again by Architecture.

# Open Questions — Daily Coach Fully Free Source-Data Lab v1

## Active

1. Does GPT-5.5 produce a meaningfully better Daily Coach note from clean source data and an extremely small prompt?
2. Does fully free source-data input reduce backend-shaped language compared with the v4 decaged diagnostic baseline?
3. Does the model use recovery, training, nutrition, food/snack, body metrics, and recent-history source data without being forced to mention every fact?
4. Does the minimal prompt preserve safety without becoming another product voice cage?
5. Are source-data completeness artifacts enough for Architecture/QA to judge whether the model was treated fairly?
6. Which data domains remain too thin for the future intelligence layers: Recovery Intelligence, Workout Set Intelligence, Trend Engine, Six-Month Seed Data, or Food Knowledge Expansion?

## Boundaries

- Developer-only lab.
- Normal Today unchanged.
- Deterministic remains safe local default.
- OpenAI/GPT-5.5 remains opt-in/evaluation-only.
- No provider promotion.
- No production persistence of provider output.
- No raw DB rows, secrets, or raw provider envelopes in artifacts.
- No RAG, embeddings, vector DB, multi-agent runtime, LangGraph, CrewAI, or LlamaIndex orchestration.

Known baseline drift remains documented and unpatched: `tests/test_daily_narrative_rich_day_service.py` expected `Read the day before adding more` vs actual `Consider the full day`.

# Open Questions — Daily Coach Free-Range Prompt + Payload Decaging v4

## Active

1. Does the decaged model-facing facts layer reduce backend-bound language compared with the full backend/debug packet?
2. Does `--prefer-decaged-prompt` improve direct and hypeman outputs without losing factual grounding?
3. Do `model_facing_coach_facts.md/json` make it clear what GPT-5.5 saw versus what remained debug-only?
4. Does `backend_label_exposure_summary.md` show that labels such as `volume_load`, `value_precision`, `quote_style`, `macro_gap`, and `internal_workout_model` were removed or translated before the prompt?
5. Does completion diagnostics reach the v4 acceptance target of `0 truncated drafts` during live GPT-5.5 QA?
6. Do food/snack cards aggregate mini-meal macros cleanly without `roughly 0g fat` or raw ingredient dumps?
7. Do direct/hypeman clean variants preserve coach energy without reckless advice, emoji spam, Markdown bold, or gym-bro clutter?
8. Is one more free-range iteration needed, or is the chain ready for Architecture to decide on merge/diagnostic baseline acceptance?

## Known baseline drift

- `tests/test_daily_narrative_rich_day_service.py` has copy-expectation drift.
- Example mismatch: expected `Read the day before adding more`; actual `Consider the full day`.
- Architecture decision: document this drift and do not patch it inside unrelated free-range experimentation.
- Full-suite green must not be claimed if the drift remains.

## Boundaries unchanged

- Developer-only free-range experiment.
- Normal Today behavior unchanged.
- Deterministic fallback remains default for product paths.
- OpenAI/direct_ollama remain opt-in/evaluation-only.
- No provider promotion, public UI, Streamlit controls, raw provider envelope persistence, secrets, raw DB dumps, medical advice generation, production meal planning, workout generation, nutrition target changes, recovery-score changes, RAG, embeddings, multi-agent runtime, or full food expansion.

# Open Questions — Daily Coach Free-Range Output Completion + Coach Surface Polish + Data Seeding v3

1. Does completion diagnostics prevent/identify cut-off free-range drafts clearly enough for QA to trust first-pass artifacts?
2. Do display-ready numeric fields prevent raw `.0`, alarming deficit ranges, enum capitalization, and awkward macro prose from leaking into coach copy?
3. Do macro and food option cards make dense nutrition data easier to inspect without replacing the full coach note?
4. Do AI snack candidates give the model practical food combinations without inventing foods outside the candidate pool?
5. Does bounded practical food seeding improve carb/fat/calorie guidance when more than lean protein is needed?
6. Does weight-trend anomaly handling suppress low-confidence 22 lb-style signals from coach copy while preserving raw debug evidence?
7. Does session naming visibility make clear whether the model saw an internal workout model label or a user-facing session name?
8. Do voice-style findings preserve useful coach energy without allowing unsafe hypeman advice?
9. Does the live GPT-5.5 run show stronger, more complete, better formatted first-pass notes after v3?

Closed boundaries for this milestone:

- developer-only tooling
- full note preserved; no Today-card renderer/compressor
- normal Today unchanged
- deterministic remains default
- OpenAI/direct_ollama explicit opt-in/evaluation-only
- no provider promotion
- no production persistence of provider output

# Open Questions — Daily Coach Free-Range Voice + Precision + Payload Enrichment v2

1. Which voice variant produces the strongest full coach note: practical, direct, strict, empathetic, or hypeman?
2. Does precision metadata reduce unnecessary `about`/`roughly` wording when values are direct while preserving hedging for estimates?
3. Does expanded food candidate structure improve useful food guidance without inventing foods, servings, timing, pairings, or claims?
4. Does `model_input_manifest.md` make it clear exactly what the model saw before Architecture judges copy quality?
5. Is set-level workout data available in this path, and if not, is the absence/reason documented clearly enough for future Workout Set Intelligence work?
6. Do recovery fields remain broad enough to support the strongest part of the free-range note?
7. Are post-hoc diagnostics useful without becoming generation-time phrase bans or product approval gates?
8. Does repeated live GPT-5.5 output become more consistent after voice and precision enrichment?

Closed boundaries for this milestone:

- developer-only tooling
- full note preserved; no Today-card renderer/compressor
- normal Today unchanged

# Open Questions — Daily Coach Full User-Day Free-Range Payload Baseline v1

1. Does GPT-5.5 produce more natural, useful Daily Coach copy when the provider prompt contains neutral user-day data instead of app-generated coach prose?
2. Does the exact `provider_input_prompt.md` confirm no app-copy cage, old Daily Coach example, deterministic fallback copy, Product Voice Audit finding, or phrase-ban wall is being fed to the model?
3. Does the full user-day packet include enough nutrition, training, recovery, and uncertainty context for useful synthesis?
4. Does the broader food candidate list improve food guidance without causing invented servings, timing, pairings, or unlogged-food claims?
5. Do repeated runs show usable consistency, or is quality a one-off lucky draft?
6. Do post-hoc app-copy and claim-risk diagnostics catch unsupported facts without altering first-pass output?
7. Is token/cost acceptable for a future provider lane if Architecture later chooses to promote any version of this path?
8. If free-range first-pass output is still backend-shaped, should Architecture route to deterministic phrase-source cleanup, a different payload design, or abandon provider copy for Daily Coach?

Closed boundaries for this milestone:

- developer-only tooling
- normal Today unchanged
- deterministic remains default
- OpenAI/direct_ollama explicit opt-in/evaluation-only
- no provider promotion
- no production persistence of provider output
- no raw provider envelopes or secrets in artifacts
- no raw DB rows
- no public UI
- no Product Voice Audit rewrite
- no phrase-ban milestone

# Open Questions — Daily Coach Wide Context Copy Cleanup + QA Readability v1

## Active

1. Does prompt/context cleanup reduce backend-shaped wording in first-pass wide-context copy without rebuilding the old phrase cage?
2. Does the writer-facing context now encourage plain food language such as `if protein is still short` instead of internal language such as `approved option` or `gap is still open`?
3. Do terminal-friendly artifacts make QA review faster and less error-prone?
4. Does the product-language scan surface copy problems without becoming a new approval gate?
5. Does `wide_context_practical_coach` remain the best current variant after cleanup?
6. Should the next architecture step be another live GPT-5.5 QA run, or a design pass for promoting only the strongest first-pass architecture ideas into the Daily Coach provider path?

## Known baseline drift

- `tests/test_daily_narrative_rich_day_service.py` has copy-expectation mismatches on the supplied `718c614` / `42d0bd4` lineage.
- Example mismatch: expected `Read the day before adding more`; actual `Consider the full day`.
- Architecture decision: document this drift and do not patch it inside unrelated wide-context copy/readability work.
- Full-suite green must not be claimed if the drift remains.

## Closed/unchanged boundaries

- Wide-context copy cleanup remains developer-only.
- Normal Today behavior is unchanged.
- Existing provider endpoint behavior is unchanged.
- Deterministic remains default.
- OpenAI/direct_ollama remain explicit opt-in/evaluation-only.
- Backend remains final authority for facts, approved context, artifact safety, and future approval decisions.
- Raw provider envelopes are not persisted in default artifacts.
- No public UI, Streamlit provider controls, RAG, embeddings, meal planning, workout generation, recovery-score, worker, scheduler, queue, or production provider promotion is included.
