# Milestone — Platform North Star + Future Stack Canonicalization v1

**Status:** `PLATFORM_NORTH_STAR_FUTURE_STACK_CANONICALIZATION_V1_IMPLEMENTATION_CANDIDATE`
**Task type:** Docs-only / project-memory / strategic architecture canonicalization
**Baseline commit:** `123d115`
**Baseline snapshot:** `fitness_ai_snapshot_2026-06-30_123d115_main_merge-daily-coach-workout-set-intelligence-v1.zip`
**Owner:** Backend Development, as routed by Architecture
**Requested final status:** `PLATFORM_NORTH_STAR_FUTURE_STACK_CANONICALIZATION_V1_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`

## Purpose

Create the canonical north-star and future-stack source of truth before archiving the current Architecture chat and onboarding a new Architecture chat.

Primary deliverable:

```text
docs/project_memory/architecture/platform_north_star_and_future_stack.md
```

## Scope

This milestone records the huge platform vision and future technology stack while preserving sequencing discipline.

It updates current project-memory docs so future chats know:

- Workout Set Intelligence v1 has been accepted and merged at `123d115`.
- The active milestone is Platform North Star + Future Stack Canonicalization v1.
- The canonical long-term architecture compass is `docs/project_memory/architecture/platform_north_star_and_future_stack.md`.
- Backend Intelligence Foundation remains the product-brain center after this docs-only milestone.
- Current Architecture chat should be archived after this milestone is merged, pushed, and snapshotted.

## Non-Goals

This milestone does not implement:

```text
runtime behavior changes
provider behavior changes
OpenAI/Ollama defaults
Today provider display
Streamlit UI changes
React/Next.js migration
API changes
schema changes
migration changes
RAG
embeddings
pgvector
Qdrant
vector DB setup
LangGraph
CrewAI
LlamaIndex
multi-agent runtime
custom GPT build
recovery intelligence changes
workout set intelligence changes
trend engine implementation
six-month seed data generation
food catalog expansion
USDA import
wearable integration
auth/billing/SaaS infrastructure
observability stack setup
cloud deployment
```

## Validation Expectation

Docs-only validation should include:

```text
git diff --check
python -m pytest tests/test_project_memory_check.py -q
python tools/project_memory_check.py
python tools/dev_assistant.py memory-check
python tools/dev_assistant.py stale-doc-check
python tools/dev_assistant.py continuity-brief
scripts/dev_commit_check.ps1 -Mode docs-only
```

## Completion Criteria

Architecture should accept this milestone only if:

- `platform_north_star_and_future_stack.md` exists.
- The file is ambitious enough to preserve the huge dream.
- The file is disciplined enough to prevent premature shiny-tech implementation.
- Future technology candidates are broad and categorized.
- SaaS/model-cost realism is recorded.
- Backend intelligence before advanced AI is explicit.
- Team routing is correct.
- Project Instructions draft is included.
- Existing docs reference the new file instead of duplicating it.
- Project memory checks pass.
- No runtime/product behavior changed.
