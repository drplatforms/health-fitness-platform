## Provider-integrated report sections

`training` only.

## Important distinction

`nutrition_target_display` is not the final nutrition voice section. It can feed the future `nutrition_report_section`, but it should not become provider-owned by itself.

## Next likely section path

Nutrition is the next logical provider candidate, but only after Nutrition Provider Readiness Review v1 confirms evidence, claims, validation, fallback, metadata, and runtime boundaries.
